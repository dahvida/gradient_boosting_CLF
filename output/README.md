# Folder description

Placeholder for the output folder. Contains the output of `hiv_script.py` as an example.  

**Notice**: the results are not numerically identical since in the original publication random seeds were not set for train-test splits and for the hyperparameter optimization procedure. The current version of the scripts uses fixed seeds for every aspect of training and evaluation and should reproduce these results reliably.
